Sub-Mod for the Somewhat More Historic Mod, part of the Historical Immersion Project for Crusader Kings 2

This repository was created in the goal of furthering work on the anglicization sub-mod for SWMH, a ck2 map mod.

If you wish to contribute, just fork this repository, make the changes locally and then create a push request.

Any changes will be discussed with the community on the forums before being merged into the main mod.
